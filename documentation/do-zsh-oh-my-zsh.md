# Add ZSH and oh-my-zsh to Digital Ocean
Make your Droplet terminal window look cooler.

I highly recommend using [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) on Macs instead of the default Terminal.

Add ZSH and oh-my-zsh to your DO Droplet.
Install ZSH on the Droplet

As root user:

`# sudo apt-get install zsh`

Then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm). If
you are not familar with ZSH. Watch this [free Wes Bos video series](http://wesbos.com/command-line-video-tutorials/).
